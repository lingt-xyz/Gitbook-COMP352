# Shortest paths

## Problem define

Given a weighted graph and two vertices$$u$$and$$v$$, we want to find a path of minimum total weight between$$u$$and$$v$$.

{% hint style="info" %}
Types of shortest paths problems

* Single-Source shortest-paths problem
* Single-destination shortest-paths problem
* Single-pair shortest-path problem
* All-pairs shortest-paths problem
{% endhint %}

## Shortest Path Properties

1. A sub-path of a shortest path is itself a shortest path.
2. There is a tree of shortest paths from a start vertex to all the other vertices.
